# Blog-Project

This is my Blog Page which is a Full Stack Web Development Project.
In this blog page i write about Fitness And Health.

I have used 
HTML, CSS, JAVASCIPT for the Frontend work 
and, 
Node.js, EJS, Mongoose and Express.ejs for the Backend Work.
I have used MongoDB Atlas AWS Cloud Service to Manage my Database in Cloud.

I have deployed my project on the Heroku Server To make it a live web app.
